# TMP75 Library STM32 HAL

Library with basic functions to use the temperature sensor TMP75C-Q1 
* [Datasheet](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tmp75c-q1.pdf)

## Getting Started
```
The project was created to be used on the microcontroller STM32l152RCT6 of the DiscoveryL152c. It is possible to export the project to any microcontroller stm32 since the abstraction of hal allows us.
